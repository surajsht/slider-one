              One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
              himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on
              his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
              see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
              stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed
              ready to slide off any moment.
